# My Neighborhood (React App)
### A Project for Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree

## Overview

Our assignment:   
Build a sigle page applicaton using React that shows places we would like to visit a map.   
Show additional information about that place form a third pary API.

## Features

In a listview you can search the list of places and only those that match will be shown in the list as well on the map.
